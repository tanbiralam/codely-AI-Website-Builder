- [ ] **Fix Rate Limit UI**
  - The rate limit logic is working correctly (user is being redirected to the pricing page when the limit is hit).
  - However, the **UI for showing the rate limit warning/credits remaining is not rendering in the chat interface**.
  - Ensure the `Usage` component (or equivalent) is properly mounted in the chat UI.
  - Verify that props (`points`, `msBeforeNext`) are being passed down correctly.
  - Make the "Upgrade" button visible alongside the rate limit message.
  - Test by simulating hitting the free credit limit:
    - [ ] UI should display remaining credits = `0`
    - [ ] Show "Resets in X time" message
    - [ ] Show **Upgrade** button
    - [ ] Redirect should still work as fallback
